<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Nebylioul Minasshe and I graduated in Architecture from Addis Abeba University and I have been practicing 
  it for over 3 years now. I also do graphic designs in addition to architecture but programing or web development 
  was one of my passions that I wanted to excel at so I started learning on an online course and am starting on 
  working on web development since.</p>

<p>I came to love web development since young age as I have seen in movies that black coding interface fascinated 
  me since we casual users see the outside while programmers see the bare atoms of said web or application it was 
  breathtaking to say the least. So, I wanted to practice web development as well and finally had the right time 
  to get started

<p>I as hobby on my free times read manga and comics I also read books and occasionally go hiking with my friends.</p>
